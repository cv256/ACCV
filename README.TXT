I developed this alternative launcher for AC (called it AC CV) because :
1) the original launcher takes too much time to start
2) I have lots of mods but when I want to find a certain type of car (lets say turbo diesel front drive between 150 and 200HP manual shift) they were not easy to find

So my launcher:
- is realy faaast !
- has all the ways of instantanely search or sort your hundreds of cars and tracks (and using notepad you can configure the uniformisation of the tags)
- you can rate cars and tracks from 1 to 10, and you can write your own comments on each
- with just 1 right-click you can see all the car skins and using another click you select one
- you can set the AI level of each opponent separately, from 10% to 99%. Mixing super cars with bad drivers and bad cars with super drivers means lots of overtakes and risky situations all the time, awesome!
- quicly save/use «favorite sets» of car/skin/track/opponents/weather/terrain/rules. Really usefull.
- quicly save/watch replays
- when you end a race it shows a graphic of each car's position along the race time.

You can have ACCV.exe wherever you want, no install needed, just this extremely small executable (just 100Kb, the original launcher has more than 5000Kb)

This version is just for 64bit, contact me if you need 32bit version.
It requires Net Framework 4.5.2. 99% of computers wil allready have it, otherwise get it from Microsoft.

You can even run ACCV.exe and AssettoCorsa.exe (the original launcher) at the same time, no problem, they both work, and they both invoke acs.exe (wich is the original main game)


I am a senior software developer for big information systems and this took me sooome to develop. I still have some ideas, but I allready work too much, goin to relax now :)
Any donation would... wow... make my day... not for the money but because that would be really nice and would motivate me to do more.
